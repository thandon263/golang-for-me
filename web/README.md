## Goal

This is a basic web server running as a static server using Go. I think there are so many ways to build server. I'm looking forward to improving the structure of the web server and adding more functionality and other cool services to this.

I'm spending this time to focus on the real important parts of Go and how I can use it to build scalable infrustructure and get improve the way we see the web from the backend.
